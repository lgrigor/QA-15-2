    You can enter your xpath query in the top-left panel 
    and it will be instantly executed against this document.
    Once some results are displayed on the right, you can 
    scroll to them by clicking on them.

  <note>
    None of entered documents leave your computer because all
    the processing is done by your powerful browser!
    (of course as long as you do not save your input)
  </note>
      <note>
    This application is in an early beta version so please
    be forgiving. XPath 2.0 is supported but namespaces are
    still being added and they may not fully work yet. 
    Please send your comments to: xpather.com@gmail.com

  <note>
    By default XML mode is used but if a document cannot
    be parsed as XML then HTML mode kicks in.
  </note>
  <note>
    Pasting documents bigger than 500kb may cause your
    browser become sluggish or unresponsive.
